# Internship Code
This is the open source code I made for my internship with Kundalini Software.

## Folder: C-Scale
In this folder, I created my first Lilypond code, experimenting with how to read and write .ly files.

In addition, I also discovered how to save the Lilypond code as a pdf.

## Folder: Parser

### Original

In this folder, I started to make the parsing code. I first experimented with

reading in a Lilypond file programmatically. Before, I only transposed with

command-line. I first managed to read the file and rewrite its entirity to another file. 

### Transpose

I then began working on the code apply a transpose to all of notes within the file.
